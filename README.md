# CS472 Group Project

Hello, CS472! This is where you can document your group project.

This project is a basic front-end e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, view the cart, and clear it — all using DOM manipulation and localStorage (no backend required).


 Features:
 
- Product cards rendered dynamically with JavaScript

- Add to Cart functionality with localStorage

- Cart page displays all added items in a table

- Remove individual items or clear the entire cart

- Automatically calculates total price

- Live cart item count displayed in the navbar

- Alerts and confirmations for better UX

- Organized, well-commented code for team collaboration
